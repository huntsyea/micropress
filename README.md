# micropress ðŸ•¹

**Micropress** isn't really a project per se -- I was looking into various techniques for [automatic text summarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization), and came up with a simple algorithm I wanted to implement myself that combined elements of existing approaches. The code you find here is an extractive text summarization algorithm implemented in Ink. It tries to produce a good-enough summary of some source text by discovering a few representaative sentences from the larger text.

A very close variation of this algorithm is used for text summarization in [Revery](https://github.com/thesephist/revery).

## Demo

If you run `ink main.ink` in the repository, the demo script will generate a summary for `./sample.txt` which contains a verbatim copy of my blog post, ["Build tools around workflows, not workflows around tools"](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/). The 1000-character summary it generates is:

>Build tools around workflows, not workflows around tools.
>
>While I was there, I thought a lot about tools â€“ mechanical tools, software tools, tools that last, and tools that are fragile. I want to share why I build my own tools and how I think we should think about building tools for life. My tools, today. I donâ€™t want to imply that my tools are objectively better than the professional tools on the market like Notion and Dropbox. Workflows > tools. Good tools fit perfectly around our workflows, bad tools donâ€™t. Instead, to use these tools, we need to bend our workflows to fit around the tools. Tools that grow with your workflows. This way, my tools can grow organically as my workflows evolve. Own your load-bearing tools of life. My productivity tools, especially my notes and contacts, are the load-bearing tools of my life. Your tools are an extension of you. How long do you expect these tools to work? Years? Decades?. Since Iâ€™m the only user of these tools, most of my tools are gated behind HTTP basic auth and TLS. Some tools have additional security layers.
